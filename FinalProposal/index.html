  <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
  
    <p > 
      Part I: Intro
      Briefly describe your project idea (2-3 sentences)
      In a portfolio, the goal is not to show the works to audiences but to show me. It is a reflection of the pieces I have done and trying to build a connection between them. The website is round a question: what did I do ???  What am I looking for exactly???

    </p>
      
       Is this a website you intend to continuing beyond this class (e.g., a portfolio, a web page for a side-project)?
      Yes
  </p>
      
      Is this website a piece of art or design that you intend to include in your portfolio as a standalone work?
      Yes

    </p>
      Is this website a chance to experiment with web code without any concrete end goal? (If this is your answer, I encourage you to think of this website as a potential portfolio entry)
      Yes
    </p>
      Is this website one large project or multiple smaller projects?
      One.

    </p>
      Part 2: Why?
      Why do you want to do this project? What do you hope to learn from the process of creating it?
      Clear my mind. Familiar with programming.

    </p>
      
      What is your primary concern with this project: making something that is easy for an audience to navigate or making something that focuses on your own experimentation with this medium?
      I want to focus on my experimentation.

    </p>
      
      Include three or websites here that help you think through what you want out of this project. Are there specific aesthetic elements on these pages you are interested in? Is it the structure or aesthetic of the website as a whole that inspires you? If you're having trouble finding websites to draw inspiration from, let me know, and we can find some together! http://tianzhuochen.com
      
    </p>
      
      Part 3: Technical
      To the best of your ability, write down some technical/code concepts you think you need to achieve your project.
      The basic of html, css, and js. And I am thinking about is there any chance add video cam into website. (like code Processing inâ€¦)
    </p>

      As it is, can you imagine actually creating your project? If you sat down and started coding right now, do you think you'd be able to make it (or at least 90% of it?).
      I can imagine finished 100% of the structure of this project in the easiest way, but for my small designs and goals, I am not sure, maybe 20% to 50%.
